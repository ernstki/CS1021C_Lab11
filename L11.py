=======
Insipred by the Mega Micro Computers game for the TRS-80 and Apple ][.

You are the head of an up-and-coming trading company based in Hong Kong
in the 19th century and the captain of your own ship.

You begin the game in your home port, and can sail to various ports in
and around the South China Sea. Other ports you may visit are Shanghai,
Nagasaki, Saigon (present day Ho Chi Min City in Vietnam), Manila,
Singapore, and Batavia (the old Dutch name for Jakarta, the capital
city of Indonesia).







NOTE: When gameplay begins, be sure to make the command area in JES at least
large enough to see this text and the TAIPAN! title at the top.

Traveling close to the mainland or to nearby ports incurs less risk
(of pirate or giant squid attacks) than traveling across open ocean.
Upon arriving at a port, you are presented with a list of neighboring
ports, which you can safely travel to under the protection of
maritime law enforcement.

You can travel to any other port (potentially crossing open ocean) by
pressing one of the number keys assigned to the desired port.

If your ship incurs damage during your travels on the high seas, you
may request repairs in your home port of Hong Kong.

The game ends when your ship is sunk by marauders, or you make
enough money to retire a millionaire.
