Game Help
---------
The game is set in 19th century Hong Kong. You are the head of an
up-and-coming trading company and the captain of your own ship.

You begin the game in your home port, and can sail to various ports in
and around the South China Sea. Other ports you may visit are Shanghai,
Nagasaki, Saigon (present day Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam), Manila,
Singapore, and Batavia (the old Dutch name for Jakarta, the capital
city of Indonesia).

Traveling close to the mainland or to nearby ports incurs less risk
(of pirate or giant squid attacks) than traveling across open ocean.
Upon arriving at a port, you are presented with a list of neighboring
ports, which you can reference by cardinal direction (North, South,
East, or West).

You can travel to any other port (potentially crossing open ocean) by
pressing one of the number keys assigned to the desired port.

If your ship incurs damage during your travels on the high seas, you
may request repairs in your home port of Hong Kong.

The game ends when your ship is sunk by marauders, you sail to each
port ten times, or you make enough money to retire a millionaire.
